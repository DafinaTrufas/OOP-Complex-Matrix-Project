# OOP-Complex-Matrix-Project

In the first part of the project, I implemented a class for matrixes with complex elements (as a friend class of the class for complex numbers), overloaded operators and created public methods for the specific matrix operations. As a follow-up, I created a derived class for square matrixes, and used virtual functions, static variables and functions, to implement some operations with both regular and square matrixes.
